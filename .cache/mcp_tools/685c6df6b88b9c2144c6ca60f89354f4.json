Our solution combines cutting-edge automated planning algorithms with a commercial game engine architecture to enable human planners to rapidly build, rehearse, and assess combat plans against peer adversaries.\n\nOur approach leverages General Admiral's existing PlannerAI platform (currently deployed in logistics optimization across 14 Fortune 500 companies) and integrates it with a modified version of the Unity game engine to create an intuitive, responsive planning environment. This integrated solution addresses both Technical Area 1 (Interactive Plan Refinement) and Technical Area 2 (Plan Gaming and Outcome Analysis) as a unified system, ensuring seamless data flow and optimal human-machine collaboration.\n\nKey Objectives:\n1. Deliver rapid plan synthesis generating plausible attack plans in under 60 seconds\n2. Provide interactive force allocation interface with real-time feasibility feedback\n3. Enable gaming-based plan execution and outcome analysis across thousands of scenarios\n4. Support continuous plan refinement with AI-guided optimization\n5. Integrate with existing Air Force data formats and classification requirements\n\n\n================================================================================\nSECTION C: TECHNICAL SUMMARY AND PROPOSED DELIVERABLES\n================================================================================\n\nTECHNICAL APPROACH\n\nGeneral Admiral's Fight Tonight solution architecture consists of four integrated components:\n\n1. RAPIDPLAN AI ENGINE (TA1 Capability)\nOur RapidPlan AI engine employs hierarchical task network (HTN) planning combined with genetic algorithms to generate course-grained attack plans within seconds. The system operates in three iterative modes:\n\n   - Instant Feasibility Mode: Returns yes/no feasibility assessment within 5 seconds based on\n     high-level resource constraints and target priorities\n   - Coarse Planning Mode: Generates 8-12 plausible plan options within 60 seconds using\n     approximation techniques for fuel, timing, and weapon-target pairings\n   - Refinement Mode: Continuously improves plan fidelity in background, adding detail on\n     routing, deconfliction, and mission timing\n\nThe engine uses Monte Carlo tree search to explore the space of task prioritizations and resource allocations, providing diversity analysis that highlights meaningful differences between plan options. Our innovation is the use of \"planning surrogates\" - lightweight models that approximate complex constraints during initial planning, then swap in high-fidelity models during refinement.\n\n2. GAMEFORGE PLANNING INTERFACE (TA2 Capability)\nBuilt on Unity 2021 LTS, GameForge provides three integrated visual interfaces:\n\n   a) Drag-and-Drop Force Allocation: Planners allocate aircraft to target sets using an\n      interactive map interface. Real-time API calls to RapidPlan provide instant feedback on\n      plan feasibility, resource conflicts, and estimated effects.\n\n   b) 4D Mission Timeline: A unique temporal visualization showing mission timing, aircraft\n      movements, and target effects across time. Planners can scrub through the mission timeline,\n      identify conflicts, and adjust timing interactively.\n\n   c) Gaming Execution Environment: Full 3D battlespace visualization for playing plans against\n      AI opponents. Supports faster-than-realtime execution (up to 100x speed) and branching\n      scenario exploration.\n\n3. ADVERSARY AI MODELS\nWe will develop three tiers of adversary AI:\n\n   - Reactive AI: Rule-based responses to friendly actions (appropriate for quick analysis)\n   - Strategic AI: Machine learning models trained on historical conflict data and wargames\n   - Expert AI: Integration with subject matter expert decision trees for high-fidelity simulation\n\nAll AI models will be tunable for difficulty/competence level, enabling planners to test against varying adversary capabilities.\n\n4. ANALYTICS & DATA ARCHITECTURE\nOur cloud-native data architecture uses PostgreSQL for plan storage with custom indexing for rapid retrieval of plan variants. Analytics engine provides:\n\n   - Plan comparison metrics (effectiveness, risk, resource utilization)\n   - Outcome distribution visualization across hundreds of simulated executions\n   - Automated variant exploration identifying plan sensitivities\n   - Export capabilities for integration with Air Force systems\n\n\nRISK MITIGATION\n\nGeneral Admiral recognizes several key risks and our mitigation strategies:\n\nRisk: Plan conditioning may require more detail than RapidPlan can efficiently generate\nMitigation: We will work closely with TA2 teams via Planning Interface Working Group to define minimum viable plan fidelity. Our hierarchical planning approach allows graceful degradation if full detail cannot be achieved within time constraints.\n\nRisk: Unity game engine may not meet classification requirements for TOP SECRET/SCI\nMitigation: General Admiral maintains a SCIF facility in Alexandria, VA with TOP SECRET/SCI accreditation. We will deploy air-gapped development environments and implement all NISPOM requirements for handling classified information.\n\nRisk: Integration between independently developed TA1 and TA2 components may prove difficult\nMitigation: By proposing an integrated solution, we eliminate integration risk. However, we commit to clean API boundaries and will participate actively in the Planning Interface Working Group to ensure our interfaces can support other performers' components if needed.\n\n\nTEAM QUALIFICATIONS\n\nGeneral Admiral brings extensive experience in AI planning and defense simulation:\n\n- 8 years developing autonomous planning systems for commercial applications\n- Current Secret-level facility clearance (TOP SECRET/SCI upgrade in progress)\n- Partnership with SimuTech Defense (small business) for adversary AI development\n- Dr. Marcus Wellington (PI) - 15 years experience in automated planning, former DARPA performer\n- Team of 12 engineers with Unity/Unreal engine experience averaging 6 years each\n- Existing relationship with AFRL for Phase 2 transition support\n\n\nPROPOSED DELIVERABLES\n\nMonth 1: Program kickoff briefing and detailed technical approach\nMonth 3: Quarterly review and documentation of planned integration approach\nMonth 5: Technical integration workshop with interface specifications\nMonth 6: PI meeting with user interface mockups and data requirements\nMonth 10: Integration event demonstrating data exchange with evaluation environment\nMonth 12: Phase 1 prototype evaluation with working RapidPlan engine and GameForge alpha\nMonth 15: Quarterly review and integration demonstration\nMonth 18: PI meeting with framework update\nMonth 20: Integration event with full component integration\nMonth 22: Integrated demo dry run\nMonth 24: Phase 1 prototype evaluation with beta system\nMonth 26: Integrated demonstration with operational stakeholders\nMonth 29: Phase 1 capstone demonstration\n\n\nCOST APPROACH\n\nOur cost proposal of $38.5M over 30 months includes:\n\n- Year 1 (Months 1-12): $14.2M - Core platform development and initial integration\n- Year 2 (Months 13-24): $16.8M - Refinement, adversary AI development, user testing\n- Year 3 (Months 25-30): $7.5M - Final integration, evaluation support, transition planning\n\nCosts include:\n- Labor: $28.4M (22 FTEs average, mix of AI engineers, game developers, systems engineers)\n- Materials/Licenses: $4.6M (Unity Pro licenses, cloud compute, hardware)\n- Subcontractors: $3.8M (SimuTech Defense for adversary AI)\n- Travel: $1.2M (integration events, user group meetings)\n- ODCs: $0.5M (facility security upgrades)\n\nWe propose a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract structure with separately priced options for Iteration 1 (months 13-24) and Iteration 2 (months 25-30) to support potential down-select.\n\n\nMETRICS AND EVALUATION\n\nGeneral Admiral commits to the following performance targets by end of Phase 1:\n\n- Plan generation time: <60 seconds for initial coarse plan, <5 minutes for executable detail\n- Interface responsiveness: <200ms lag for all user interactions\n- Plan quality: Successfully schedule 95%+ of requested missions given adequate resources\n- Workload reduction: Enable 2-person team to generate and assess plans vs. current 20+ person staff\n- User acceptance: >80% positive feedback from operational planners in evaluation events\n- Scenario scale: Support planning for 1000+ targets, 500+ aircraft, 50+ bases\n\nWe will conduct internal user testing with retired Air Force planners monthly starting Month 6 to continuously refine usability.\n\n\nPARTNERSHIP AND TRANSITION\n\nGeneral Admiral recognizes that operational adoption is critical to program success.
