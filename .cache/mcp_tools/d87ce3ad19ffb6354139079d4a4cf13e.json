TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENTS:\nThe Air Force Research Laboratory is soliciting white papers under this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for research, development, integration, test and evaluation of technologies/techniques that revolutionize air operations planning by leveraging artificial intelligence, with an interactive game engine for building, rehearsing and assessing combat plans. This capability will enable combat planners to quickly reason about plan options and plausible futures, increasing planners\u2019 confidence that they have crafted the best plan possible within the constraints of a highly dynamic conflict against peer adversaries.\nThe U.S. military air combat planning process has evolved to require hundreds of experts working in concert to develop the plan needed to conduct military operations and fulfill Commander\u2019s Intent. The future operating environment is expected to feature more mobile and fleeing targets that demand greater agility in planning to support execution. Hostilities against a peer adversary will likely demand a high sortie rate due to the speed of conflict and a potential numerical disadvantage. Current planning processes are generally serial and provide limited opportunity for sufficient analysis of options, requiring time-consuming plan adjustment and repair as conditions evolve during execution. While current processes generate efficient plans under controlled conditions, the pace and scale of future conflicts threaten to exceed current planning pace and required flexibility. \nAir Operations Center (AOC) planning is an alchemy of interpreting strategic guidance, traditional optimization of known quantities (e.g., fuel burn rate, weapons capacity, logistics requirements) and unpredictability (maintenance issues, adversary actions). While automation excels at optimizing over well-defined variables, humans are better suited to understanding the strategic imperatives and reasoning under uncertainty. However, humans are limited in cognitive throughput and are constrained in their ability to reason over many potential futures. \nThe Fight Tonight program seeks to accelerate the planning process and to allow the exploration of potential courses of action for the AOC Strategy and Combat Plans divisions. The Strategy Division in the AOC converts guidance to objectives, performs mission analysis, course of action development, analysis and selection. These processes will be enhanced by tools that can generate and assess the feasibility of more plans than humans are capable of without the aid of technology. The Combat Plans Division develops detailed execution plans that meet the constraints of the operating environment, performing the detailed analysis and generation of artifacts for Air Tasking Order (ATO) preparation and re-tasking. The complexity of these activities and the need for close collaboration are the main drivers for the 36 hours currently used to complete the Master Air Attack Plan (MAAP) process in the AOC. This complexity reduces agility in competition with peer adversaries, motivating new concepts of operations. The Government envisions one such concept in Figure 1, with the Fight Tonight program providing the interface for continuous planning and refinement of strategy and operational assessment. While they are also critical functions, ATO production and execution management are not considered as part of this solicitation.\nArtificial Intelligence alone cannot meet this challenge, human insight is required to guide and interpret automated planning and analysis in order to confidently issue courses of action. A Human and Artificial Intelligence driven collaborative planning system, combined with an interactive game engine, provides a leap-ahead capability for human planners to act at pace and scale. The interactive game engine would serve as the foundation for plan development, rehearsal and assessment under uncertain and dynamic conditions and is envisioned as the primary method for users to interact with the overall Fight Tonight system. The goal is to provide users with a consistent visual interface and environment to explore and select an allocation of forces, play, pause, and rewind the attack plan to understand critical decision points, manipulate the plan in real-time, assess potential plan changes, and explore various hypotheses for possible operating conditions. \nThe Fight Tonight program will develop tools that enable human users to work in collaboration with Artificial Intelligence to conduct air combat planning within 4 hours and incrementally conduct re-planning in minutes, while simultaneously exploring the trade-off between multiple options and their expected outcomes. Additionally, Fight Tonight will develop tools that optimize the role of the humans and machines \u2013 humans provide deep insight and creativity, while machines excel at reasoning over constraints and generating a detailed analysis of available options.\nFigure 1. Fight Tonight will enable AOC planners to rapidly respond to an evolving battlespace and Combat Command (COCOM) strategy at pace and scale required for a peer adversary.\nDeveloping plans in coordination with Artificial Intelligence at the pace and scale of future operations will require a common infrastructure with the following capabilities:\nFormalization of the representation and data needed to feed AI models and analytics.\nFlexible and persistent data interfaces serving Fight Tonight modeling and analytical capabilities timely information about the operating environment, as well as consumer applications with modeling and analytical output from Fight Tonight.\nInteractive user interfaces for users to provide guidance, real-time feedback, and quickly communicate details of complex operating environments in real time.\nComputationally scalable representations to manage state and update of large numbers of entities in an interactive, real-time environment.\nCapture and maintenance of gameplay for replay and analysis.\nCommercial games have demonstrated the capability to meet these requirements but are generally developed as entertainment products with limited focus on planning courses of action. For example, commercial games like StarCraft II and Rome: Total War place the player in command of complex forces in real-time, providing multiple viewpoints for managing resources, maneuvers, and strategy. The Air Force Research Laboratory seeks to leverage the advances made in the commercial gaming industry, integrated with operational data and planning processes, to deliver a game-based planning engine for the Air Operations Center. \nThe envisioned game-based planning process will be non-serial, allowing users to develop an initial plan at coarse resolution and then iterate on finer levels of detail, with flexibility to return to lower fidelity planning as desired. It is envisioned that automated analysis will provide insight at all stages of planning, ranging from statistical analysis based on modeled uncertainty to execution of the plan using artificial intelligence to emulate friendly and adversary decision making. While Fight Tonight will build upon the well-established base of automated planning and scheduling technology, current capabilities are insufficient to meet the needs of the program vision and have limited integration with the data and framework required for continuous planning and outcome assessment. \nThe over-arching strategy of this five (5) year open BAA is to quickly and efficiently execute research and development to deliver practical solutions to urgent problems.  These efforts are anticipated to entail rapidly integrating existing technology into field testable, functional prototypes that extends the state-of-the-art in two key areas:\nInteractive Plan Refinement. The ability to generate an executable plan via a user-guided, exploratory process of resource allocation and task prioritization. This service will aid the user to design allocations of forces to tasks, understand what options are available, and assess the impact of adjusting priorities. The proposed solution must be able to consider critical factors such as levels of acceptable risk, rules of engagement, friendly order of battle, enemy order of battle and the Joint Integrated Prioritized Target List (JIPTL).   \nPlan Gaming and Outcome Analysis. The ability to interactively simulate execution of attack plans, assess variance of outcomes based on uncertainty, and generate empirical analysis of plausible futures.  Planners should be able to explore and understand how a plan will unfold against a simulated adversary employing a variety of strategies and/or responses. The proposed solution should also support modification of plan elements, operating conditions, and capabilities for both friendly and adversary forces to determine how those changes will impact plan effectiveness and risk.\nThese technical challenges will be addressed as a two-phase program effort directed towards the development and evaluation of an integrated system that will be evaluated in a realistic military environment. The first phase of the program will focus on building a compelling technical demonstration of the Fight Tonight system, with the second phase intended to transition the developed capability for operational use in an AOC. The resulting planning system will need to address the inherent challenges of planning and analysis on fixed time periods, as well as integration with the human-guided automation to consider the cognitive needs of the human directing the planning process. In order to facilitate possible integration into larger enterprise platforms (e.g., Kessel Run), a robust software architecture will be needed to ensure Fight Tonight data and metadata is exposed and consumable by other applications and services (e.g., planners, gaming engines).\nProgram Structure\nInteractive plan refinement and plan gaming and outcome analysis comprise the two technical areas (TAs) of Fight Tonight development efforts. Figure 2 provides an overview of capabilities envisioned for each of the technical areas and how they are intended to interact, and Section 1.3 provides an overview of the objectives for each phase.  \nFigure 2. Notional functional components for the Fight Tonight architecture, and their association to Technical Areas requested in this BAA.  Acronym Definition:  Machine Learning (ML)\nTechnical Area Overviews\nTechnical Area 1: Interactive Plan Refinement\nInteractive plan refinement will provide planners with tools to explore options for achieving mission goals through an iterative process. The system will initially produce coarse-grained, plausible plans based on user-provided guidelines on prioritization of multiple tasks and/or constraints. Automated analytics will enable planners to rapidly assess generated plan alternatives, and the system will work in parallel to continue refining candidate plans and increase the level of detail using available computational resources. This iterative process will require automated planning methods that emphasize speed over precision early in the process, then adapting based on continuous planner guidance to refine plan elements to a sufficient level of detail for simulated execution. This technical area must address the following challenges:\nPlan Synthesis \u2013 an automated process that generates plausible, approximate attack plans based on user-supplied objectives, resource allocations, and constraints. Automation will provide planners immediate feedback on plan feasibility in real time as they adjust allocations, informing further decisions.\nPlan Diversity Analysis \u2013 generates multiple plans based on varying prioritization of mission tasks and constraints and provides analytical assessment of the significant differences in performance and risk between the available options. This will free the user from having to inspect all options in order to understand the inherent trade-offs.\nIterative Planning \u2013 an automated process for refining plans towards an increasing level of fidelity, allowing for early planner assessment and exploration of options before more computationally demanding plan elements are developed. This process may be interrupted in real-time as plan options are eliminated or additional guidance is provided by human planners.\nPlan Conditioning \u2013 brings plans to a sufficient level of detail for simulated execution within the TA2 gaming environment. This will help to bridge the analysis gap between plans and outcomes and provide additional confidence that a plausible plan is executable.\nBy addressing these challenges, Fight Tonight will develop capabilities to help human planners assess the effectiveness of plan options with respect to objectives at the increased pace and scale of future operations. There is no user interface anticipated for TA1 (apart from configuration and administrative function), with interactions between TA1 and TA2 components being defined through a Planning Interface that will be developed via participation in the Planning Interface Working Group (see Section 1.3 for additional details).\nTechnical Area 2:  Plan Gaming and Outcome Analysis\nThe gaming platform will provide deep insight and experience with combat plans, allowing planners to analyze expected performance and update plans based on simulated outcomes. This is a key innovation that seeks to leverage commercial gaming technology to build intuitive, responsive interfaces that are designed to maximize human understanding of complex operating environments. Interface capabilities include faster-than-real-time plan execution, visual representation of spatial and temporal events of interest that have impact on plan outcomes, and methods for depicting where plan outcomes diverge or converge based on events. This technical area must address the following challenges:\nGaming Interface - a human-centered, interactive set of visual interfaces for building, rehearsing, and assessing combat plans, driving and leveraging automation underlying the Fight Tonight system of systems. These interfaces will aid planners in contemplating the plausibility of force allocation and task prioritization options, the performance of the resulting plan against a simulated adversary, and the implications of hypothetical operating conditions.\nPlan/Analytics Data Store \u2013 a data storage solution with indexing across related plans, variations, assessment, and outcomes. Data representations and storage will need to account for the continuous refinement of plan options and the need for analytical techniques to access multiple plan options simultaneously.\nAI Behavior Models \u2013 automated players for friendly and adversary forces, enabling simulated plan execution and response to events. This will drive analysis of outcomes by executing plans over a range of conditions and uncertainty to support statistical analysis and visualization.\nPlanning Execution Engine \u2013 a game environment for plan execution enabling analysis of expected plan outcomes under uncertainty and against varying adversary strategies. Adversary and friendly forces should be able to execute autonomously, driven by AI players of varying strategy and skill. The environment allows planners to explore potential futures, further refining the pace and timing of effects, constrain operating parameters, and identify opportunities and vulnerabilities that could emerge during conflict.\nPlan Analytics Engine \u2013 automated analytics to aggregate data on the various outcomes and present the planners with an overall assessment of the resulting outcome space. A visual depiction of these results will aid planners in focusing their efforts on the most likely and worst-case outcomes as part of the overall risk assessment process.\nAuto Exploration \u2013 automated exploration of adjustments to friendly and adversary resources, capabilities, and constraints to determine what impacts those changes will have on expected outcomes. Significant changes may require re-engaging with TA1 planning capabilities to generate new plans, with or without planner interaction.\nThis technical area is inherently human-driven, and development of interfaces and functional elements are driven by human decision processes. The decision space covered is both large and complex, introducing challenges for human cognitive bandwidth and allocation of analysis to a team of planners. The TA2 gaming interfaces will be the primary means by which planners interact with the system, providing a seamless progression from the exploration of plausible option, to understanding the potential outcomes based on uncertainty and adversarial strategy.\n Evaluation Support\nA Government-led team (composed of Government, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, and potentially University Affiliated Research Center personnel) will design and conduct empirical performance evaluations throughout the life of the program. The Government intends to have the evaluation team provide a representative evaluation scenario and evaluation metrics to the technology development teams at kickoff. The evaluation team will continue to work with TA 1 and 2 performers during Phase 1 to provide an evaluation framework that will assist the development and assessment of component technologies. During Phase 2 and beyond, the evaluation team will work directly with the TA 1 and 2 performers to connect the integrated Fight Tonight capability to operational data sources. TA 1 and 2 performers will not integrate prototypes with Government systems during Phase 1 \u2013 instead the Government-led team will evaluate TA 1 and 2 capability demonstrations throughout Phase 1 and the proposed Fight Tonight system designs at the end of Phase 1.\nThe evaluation team will provide the following data inputs to TA1 and TA2 performers for development and demonstration in Phase 1:\nBasing: The physical locations where available air units and aircraft are located.\nAircraft Models: The set of parameters defining the available resources used by the planner (e.g., fuel capacity and burn rates).\nStandard Configuration Loads (SCLs): Specific valid combinations of equipment and munitions for each aircraft type \nAir Units: An air unit maintains a group of aircraft of the same type at an air base. Multiple units may be located at the same base.\nUnit Contracts: Each air unit has a unit contract that defines how many sorties it will provide each day using its available aircraft. The unit contract also defines time windows during which the sorties can occur, and other constraints.\nAirspace Control Measures: The geographical coordinates of relevant air space regions like orbits, air refueling tracks, battlespace boundaries, etc.\nTargets and Target-Weapon Pairings: The prioritized list of targets (with location, description, etc.) and the munitions (type and quantity) recommended for use against them.\nNon-Strike Mission Requests: Additional requests for orbit based, ground alert, or other types of missions requiring aircraft support.\nRed Order of Battle: The estimated physical locations of adversary units and bases, as well as their capabilities against friendly forces. While some unit locations will be known, planning under uncertainty is expected to be a critical aspect of this program and the evaluation.  \n Program Phased Effort\nTo successfully demonstrate continuous planning with collaboration between human planners, automated planning, and interactive gaming platforms, AFRL expects all program performers to participate in refining the problem definition, identifying system requirements, and establishing interfaces, etc. At program start, the evaluation team will lead the effort of refining the functional architecture in coordination with the Government-led Strategic Planning User Group (comprised of operational users and subject matter experts) and Planning Interface Working Group (comprised of the Government-led evaluation team and representatives from each of the performers) that will be established at program kick-off and continue through the life of the program.\nThe Fight Tonight program will be conducted over a four-and-a-half-year period, in the following two phases:\nPhase 1 (30 months)\nThe first phase of Fight Tonight will focus upon ensuring that the available data and technology being developed in TA1 and TA2 are comprehensive and realistic in meeting the needs and requirements of air campaign planners and relying upon data and knowledge that can reasonably be expected to be available to Fight Tonight applications. TA1 and TA2 development in this phase will be focused on ensuring that the program meets the needs of AOC planning staffs operating in a realistic environment.  There will be strong emphasis on integrated capability demonstrations, with a focus on defining extensible and flexible interfaces and data standards. This includes identifying gaps between the needs of Strategy and Combat Plans Division staffs (gap identification will be conducted through the Strategic Planning User Group, with participation from all performers) and capabilities being developed in TA1 and TA2 (via the Planning Interface Working Group). There should also be a heavy emphasis on human factors system design to ensure that strategic and operational planning capabilities enable users to retain the insight and control provided by current manual processes. All efforts will focus upon framework design and architectural prototyping, testing the internal interface specifications, and the identification of interfaces between Fight Tonight internal and external components.\nFigure 3. Fight Tonight Phase 1 iterative assessment process.\nDuring this program phase, data artifacts and execution scenarios will be developed (by the Government-led evaluation team) for performers to evaluate the performance of their capabilities independently of the other Fight Tonight components. To facilitate this assessment, AFRL is planning a user-focused, iterative series of evaluation, depicted in Figure 3. At the culmination of each evaluation, all TA1 and TA2 capabilities will be assessed against the evolving test scenario and data set, with a goal of ensuring that the input/output requirements of the TA1 and TA2 capabilities are aligned. This process is intended to ensure that the TA1 and TA2 performers understand the needs of potential users, that their input/output assumptions are realistic, and that the scenarios being developed are sufficient to support the research and development and evaluation requirements for each TA1 and TA2 performer. This iterative refinement process also reflects the expectation that it is going to require substantial engineering effort in order to provide TA1 and TA2 performers with the data they need to develop and refine their technology. Note that it is expected that interfaces will converge through the iterative refinement process, informed by integration events, assessments, and the program-wide Planning Interface Working Group.\nWith the anticipated co-evolution of technology and concepts of operations at the Air Operations Center, the Government-led evaluation team will continue to identity and define key technical objectives, and their relative impact on program scope. The Government-led evaluation team will derive an analysis plan from these technical objectives in order to assess how well these objectives are being met. Based on this analysis, and in coordination with the Strategic Planning User Group, the Government-led evaluation team will develop a data collection plan that outlines what data will be collected in order to satisfy the analysis plan and measure to meet program objectives.\nThe Fight Tonight program will focus upon the integration and evaluation of capabilities in a functional prototype deployed in a realistic Air Force context. Components will be assessed for their ability to support planning staff to rapidly build, rehearse, and assess combat plans. Two major evaluation events with operational stakeholders are anticipated at roughly 12 and 24 months into the first phase, followed by a Phase 1 capstone demonstration in month 30.  These evaluation events assess the potential for performers to be successful in Phase 2, based on metrics outlined in Section 1.6.1. \nPhase 2 (24 months)\nThe final phase of the program will be driven towards a compelling demonstration of Fight Tonight\u2019s ability to support air operations planning in a major Air Force evaluation context, to include planning for thousands of targets as part of a coalition force. An integrated prototype will be linked to the external systems necessary to support full-scale scenarios developed and conducted in close cooperation with representatives from operational and acquisition communities within the Air Force.\nAll proposals should only address Phase I. \nTechnical Area Work Plans\nTechnical Area 1\nThe interactive plan refinement is intended to be iterative, with increasing fidelity and breadth of response as the analysis progresses. Initially, a planner seeks to determine if a plausible plan exists for a breadth of task prioritizations and allocations of forces to tasks provided by the planner through a specified TA2 interface. In parallel, the system continues to refine candidate plans to bring them closer to executable form and searching for additional plan options that maximize different objectives while meeting the specified constraints. The content and status of these plan options are continuously sent to the TA2 planner interface and provided to the user in visual form to aid in their assessment and further refinement.\nFor Phase 1 of the Fight Tonight program, human planner intent will be specified as a high-level set of objectives and constraints, a general apportionment of forces, and a prioritized list of potential targets, in a digital format. In this context, TA1 is devoted to creating the technology necessary to ingest data provided at run time and provide a service-based optimization engine that can generate feasible plan options and the associated analytics in real-time, as a component of a responsive and interactive user interface. These automated processes may be interrupted or altered by the planner at any time as they consider new options, eliminate options, and adjust or refine candidate plan options in the system. Therefore, it is critical that proposed planning technology is flexible and continuous, opposed to traditional methods focused on \u201csolving\u201d a single problem before providing the user with the results.\nIn general, key inputs for the services under TA1 include data on target priorities, associations of targets or target types to a task, multiple task prioritization options, adversary and friendly unit locations and status, airspace designations, valid aircraft standard configurations, and pairing of weapons with targets, including the associated probability of successful target effects. Specific details, including the size, frequency and means of delivery of this information will be determined as a part of the iterative concept refinement process planned for Phase 1, but the overall intention of the program is for TA1 to enable rapid TA2 human-guided planning and assessment to explore the possibility space.\nAFRL anticipates making two TA1 awards and will likely continue with a single performer through the end of Phase 1, based on the performer\u2019s ability to generate plausible coarse-grained plans from user input, iteratively refine plans into an executable form, support the need for interactive human-guided planning, and the integration of capability with the TA2 data interface. In order to enable a down-select of performers, the Government may request that proposals include separately priced options for Iteration 1 (months 13 through 24 of performance) and Iteration 2 (months 25 through 30 of performance). Proposals to this area may use representations that make sense from the perspective of their technology. However, these representations will ultimately need to be shared across the set of Fight Tonight functions, and the Planning Interface Working Group will be responsible for converging on a standard representation that can be used by all Fight Tonight performers. Thus, TA1 proposers should plan to work with TA2 performers via the Planning Interface Working Group to ensure that the standard developed supports their requirements. TA1 proposals should address the following capabilities when submitting a proposal:\n Plan Synthesis\nGiven a prioritization of tasks and allocation of resources (e.g., aircraft, munitions, equipment), TA1 technology should respond with a plausible, course-grained plan for of delivering effects on targets based on available munitions, equipment, estimated flight duration and associated fuel requirements. This service is expected to be called in real-time to feed user interaction, prioritizing response time over accuracy in early interactions, with faster responses ideal for rapid development and assessment of plan options by the user. In order to meet interactive timelines, TA1 technology will likely utilize approximations of certain plan elements in order to reduce problem complexity for rapid response on plausibility queries, with iterative increases in fidelity in order to generate plan options and the correlated analytics. The ability to manage the demanding time constraints for interactive planning is a key challenge for rapid plan optimization.\n Iterative Planning\nEach plan option should be able to iteratively evolve from a plausible, course-grained plan to a fleshed-out plan of sufficient detail to be executed within the TA2 gaming environment. This process will be critical for meeting the pace and scale requirements of future operations. Proposals must address the strategy for enabling this capability, including identification of specific plan elements that are likely to require the most computation, plan elements that are most amenable to approximation and iterative refinement, and a methodology for user-guided changes of plans during the refinement process. It is also critical that the iterative refinement process takes place in parallel with other user activities, and on multiple plan options simultaneously, motivating approaches for managing limited computational resources.\n Plan Diversity Analysis\nOptions for task prioritization and resource allocation form a complex decision space that will likely be too large for manual assessment by planners. Managing this complexity will be aided by data and analytics that compare the trade-offs of effectiveness and risk for each plan option, which will be presented visually in the TA2 user interface. As additional options are generated or existing options are refined, these analytics should be updated in real-time and presented to the planners to aid in the decision process. Proposals should address the need for analytical techniques, the resulting output, and methods for reflecting iterative changes in multiple plan options. Because the plan options are quickly evolving and may be fleeting, there is a need for rapid execution of analysis, emphasizing timely delivery of insight over high accuracy.\n Plan Conditioning \nThe gaming of plan options is a key innovation of the Fight Tonight program, requiring that plan options eventually become executable plans that can be assessed based on simulated outcomes. To meet this requirement, plan options will need to be at a sufficient level of fidelity to be ingested by the Plan Execution Engine in TA2 through the Planning Interface and with data standards determined by the Planning Interface Working Group. The specifics of this level of detail are unknown at the time of this solicitation, but proposals should address methods to assess plan sufficiency and identify specific risks that may be incurred due to this requirement. Additionally, planners may propose changes to plans within the gaming environment that violate key dependencies or constraints, requiring re-engagement with the iterative planning process for that plan option. Methods for assessing the need to re-engage in the plan development process are encouraged, but the nature of this interaction will not be clear during early technology development.\nTechnical Area 2\nThe goal of TA2 is to develop and demonstrate the Fight Tonight interactive system, including the software infrastructure, user interfaces, and planning workflow. This includes support of evaluations and demonstrations through the life of the program and facilitating transition. The relatively short timeline to complete these complex tasks necessitates a seamless transition between modes of operation and motivates the TA2 performer being the integrator across these capabilities. \nA key innovation under Fight Tonight is the use of a gaming engine to provide planners with an interactive capability to explore and refine combat plans. Commercial games have demonstrated a capability for visual and analytical abstraction of complex operating environments combined with real-time interaction to assess and control forces under the users\u2019 command. For Phase 1 of the Fight Tonight program, the use of gaming as a tool for attack plan development will be demonstrated, including interfaces to the TA1 services, user interfaces and ingestions of provided data artifacts by the evaluation team. Specific details, such as the required timelines for plan assessment and data formats, will be determined as a part of the iterative concept refinement process planned for Phase 1, but the overall intention of the program is for TA2 to enable development, analysis and refinement of a MAAP within 4 hours by the end of the program. TA2 is intended to develop an interactive user interface with a consistent set of visual interface elements, creating a common user experience for the entire attack plan planning process. \nThe commercial gaming industry has evolved a mature set of tools for efficient design, implementation, and rendering of visual interfaces, so proposers should leverage these capabilities when possible, or provide justification on why existing tools are not appropriate for this task. The game interface will evolve based on feedback from the user community via the Strategic Planning User Group, stakeholder participation in program integration and assessment events, the capabilities of the TA1 optimization service, and data standards determined by the Planning Interface Working Group. This evolution necessitates a flexible and modular architecture for integration of the game engine components, data storage and retrieval, and user input into planning processes.\nGame-Based Planner Interfaces\nThe development of a set of interactive graphical user interfaces will empower planners to quickly build, rehearse, and assess plan options. To support this vision, the program asserts that a set of visually consistent interfaces with shared user interface elements across all phases of the planning process will maximize the ability for planners to rapidly develop and refine combat plans. To realize this capability, the Government envisions three key interfaces that embody functionality with somewhat distinct, but inherently overlapping, scope and purpose.\nInteractive Force Allocation \nThe program envisions the first step of the planning process could be allocation of resources to meet specified objectives and constraints within the operating environment. This process is envisioned as an interactive \u201cdrag and drop\u201d interface, with real-time system responses from the TA1 systems to assess the current strategy. The goal of this step is to understand if a plausible plan exists based on task priorities, constraints, dependencies, and available resources, and what other options may provide a suitable or preferred alternative. Plan options will be assessed by analytics provided in TA1, which will be presented to the user in an integrated interface during the interactive planning process.\nPlanning Gaming Engine \nOnce a plausible plan option has been sufficiently refined into an executable plan, planners can execute the plan in a game environment to gain insight into the space of plausible outcomes. The program envisions options for the planners to play their plan against varying adversary AI opponents, play against another human planner or adversary subject matter expert, or direct a friendly AI and adversary AI to play against each other in order to sample a larger space of outcomes. Capturing the diversity (or similarities) of outcomes and presenting a concise depiction in visual form will be critical to support rapid decision making and further refinement.\nHypothesis Generation \nDuring or after plan execution in the game environment, planners may pose changes to the plan or the operating environment, with the system providing feedback on how those changes affect the currently viewed plan and associate completion of mission objectives. The changes could include added or reduced resources available to friendly or adversary forces, changes in airspace restrictions, additional basing options, or changes in friendly or adversary behavior to be executed by the AI players. The Fight Tonight program seeks approaches that will enable users to explore these changes as branches of the baseline plan, with options for committing changes and having them be part of the revised baseline.\nGeneral Game-Based System Capabilities\nTo realize the Fight Tonight vision, the program assumes there are a set of underlying capabilities that will be needed to drive the interaction between human planners and Artificial Intelligence. Note that these are intended to be capability descriptions and may not reflect the proposed functional architecture.\nPlan Execution Engine\nGiven a plan generated through interaction with the optimization service, Fight Tonight envisions providing planners with the capability to play through the execution of the plan in an interactive gaming environment. This will require the generation of the scene elements, mapping of plan actions to the respective units, and instantiation of AI behaviors (as directed by the user). The data requirements for this capability are expected to be a critical discussion between TA1 and TA2 teams as part of the Planning Interface Working Group.\nAI Behavior Models\nTo enable automated play of friendly or adversary forces, AI models could be made available for general use or trained against plan instances, as time permits in the planning process. It is envisioned that these models could have some combination of \u201cmicro\u201d AI for controlling individual units, and a \u201cmacro\u201d AI for directing behavior of multiple units. Additionally, there would be value in having AI models of varying strategy, providing planners with an analysis of plausible plan outcomes against an uncertain adversary under varying conditions.\nAuto Variant Exploration\nWhile human plan manipulations will be invaluable to explore the possibility space of plans and operating conditions, the program envisions an automated capability to explore variants of plans and operating conditions to identify potential opportunities or vulnerabilities. This will require a capability to search the space of plan adjustments (still adhering to critical constraints and dependencies) and assessing the changes in outcomes. The results of this analysis would ultimately rely on the human to determine the likelihood of the hypothetical scenario, the opportunity versus risk it entails, and if it warrants further exploration.\nPlan Analytics Engine\nGiven the elements of uncertainty for a plan, adversary response, or operating environment, simulated execution of multiple plan options provides insight into the space of possibility and the most likely outcomes. The program envisions the use of analytics to aggregate data on the various outcomes and present the planners with an overall assessment of the resulting outcome space. A visual depiction of these results will aid planners in focusing their efforts on the most likely and worst-case outcomes as part of the overall risk assessment process.\nPlan & Analytics Data Store\nFacilitating game play of plans, managing manipulations and analytics, and presenting aggregate information to users requires a data storage solution with indexing across related plans, variations, assessment, and outcomes. Data representations and storage will need to account for the continuous refinement of plan options and the need for analytical techniques to access multiple plan options simultaneously. Additionally, data will need to be accessible by external services to continue the AOC planning process.\nSoftware Architecture and Integration\nIn order to reduce costs, avoid duplication of effort, and focus program resources on other high-risk development, TA2 proposals should focus upon assembling an appropriate set of existing commercially available, open source and government-owned software capabilities, leveraging existing message sets and standard interfaces to the maximum extent possible. Proposals to develop new capabilities should address the technology gaps being addressed to justify the need for custom solutions. Proposers to this task should clearly describe the software development process that they intend to use. Processes and data interfaces should be flexible enough to support the program need for integration of independently developed functionality, with enough rigor to produce reliable, tested software with adequate documentation.\nAs the systems integrator, the TA2 performers will be responsible for the integration of TA1\ncapabilities into the Fight Tonight prototype system that will be demonstrated during Phase 1 (and in the notional Phase 2) of the program. They will support technology evaluations by providing iterative versions of their software framework to TA1 researchers so that the Government can assess the performance of the TA1 services, as well as the framework\u2019s ability to support that performance. It is critical that the TA2 performers create a common runtime environment that can support the flexible integration of software capabilities, including core infrastructure services such as communications and access to shared models and data stores.\nAs the integration lead for Fight Tonight, TA2 performers will need to be able to access secure facilities and design software solutions that can be used in classified environments, coordinating activities across multiple security levels. Consequently, proposers to TA2 must demonstrate the ability to access and store data at the TOP SECRET/SCI level. Finally, in order to facilitate transition, the TA2 performers should demonstrate knowledge of current and in development Air Force planning systems and demonstrate how their prototype middleware will enable integration into those environments.\nAFRL anticipates making two TA2 awards and will likely continue with a single performer through the end of Phase 1 based on assessments of usability, responsiveness, scalability, and potential for operational transition in Phase 2. This decision will be based upon several factors, including assessments of usability and scalability, the overall system design, a proposed integration and risk mitigation plan for Phase 2, the performer\u2019s ability to assist with technology transition, and the performance of a prototype developed during Phase 1. In addition, Phase 1 prototypes will be evaluated for their demonstrated ability to enable a trained user to rapidly generate and analyze attack plans based on dynamic data and constraints, interoperate with existing Air Force planning software (to facilitate transition), provide robust cyber defense, and operate over multiple security levels. In order to enable a down-select of performers, the Government may request that proposals include separately priced options for Iteration 1 (months 13 through 24 of performance) and Iteration 2 (months 25 through 30 of performance).\nSchedule and Deliverables\nTable 1. Schedule of planned milestones and deliverables for Fight Tonight.\nProgram Metrics\nFight Tonight metrics\nFight Tonight is developing tools that will enable planners to rapidly build, rehearse, and assess combat plans. To measure progress to this end, AFRL expects to have a Government-led evaluation team develop a set of metrics that can be used to gauge the ability of the Fight Tonight system, and functional components, to facilitate effective plan development. Proposers are expected to offer metrics of their own, tailored to the specifics of the technology that is being proposed, and explain how they expect these metrics to be effectively collected. The table below offers some high-level candidate metrics as examples of the sort of information that the Government is interested in measuring throughout the life of the program.\nMetrics collected from Fight Tonight\u2019s performance in evaluation and demonstration environments will be more meaningful if they can be compared to a baseline that is representative of how planning is executed today. This is challenging because current processes have been optimized to take advantage of generous planning timelines and compartmentalized planning staffs. AFRL expects to work with the U.S. military to establish such a baseline, particularly with respect to the ability to prepare plans and assess their expected outcomes.\nUser acceptance of the system and user interfaces is of particular interest, though likely one of the more difficult aspects of the system to accurately measure. User feedback will be obtained through the Strategic Planning User Group and stakeholder involvement in evaluation events. All capabilities should account for human factors in their design, development, and evaluation plan, as ensuring end users are able to understand and provide input to the automation being developed is essential to the successful transition of Fight Tonight technology to the military. However, AFRL is not interested in new human factors research methods as part of this solicitation.\nMeasurement Approach\nIn Phase 1, the Government expects to use representative scenarios that will support the development of the integrated prototype during Phase 2. Three formal evaluation events are planned for Phase 1. While the details will be developed by the evaluation team and finalized during program execution, the first of these events will emphasize the assessment of the rapid planning and analysis functions to meet a 4-hour timeline for developing a Master Air Attack Plan. The second evaluation event will do the same with increased focus on exceeding current capabilities for planning, understanding options and assessing outcomes.  The final evaluation event is intended to be a technical demonstration of the overall Fight Tonight system as an interactive human-centered planning system. While three such events are currently planned, all details are still to be determined and subject to change. While AFRL is interested in collecting metrics to support the analysis of progress during Phase 2, it is expected that the formal demonstration events will be conducted under the auspices of other organizations. Consequently, the ability to measure performance will need to be assessed and success criteria established in conjunction with these third parties.\nEvaluation\nThe Government is planning to conduct independent evaluations that will be defined and conducted by organizations without conflicts of interest with TA1 and TA2 performers. The evaluators will be responsible for providing scenarios, representative input data, and user roles and responsibilities, as well as for collecting and analyzing results. In order to support this commitment, it is essential that TA1 and TA2 proposers also clearly explain how they intend to evaluate technological progress via internal assessments to meet the Fight Tonight program vision articulated in this BAA. Proposals offering to address both technical areas are encouraged to develop clean interfaces that enable software components to be decoupled and, potentially, integrated with other technical solutions delivering similar functionality. \nIMPORTANT NOTES REGARDING:\nFUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH.  It is DoD policy that the publication of products of fundamental research will remain unrestricted to the maximum extent possible. National Security Decision Directive (NSDD) 189 defines fundamental research as follows:\n\u2018Fundamental research\u2019 means basic and applied research in science and engineering, the results of which ordinarily are published and shared broadly within the scientific community, as distinguished from proprietary research and from industrial development, design, production, and product utilization, the results of which ordinarily are restricted for proprietary or national security reasons. \nAs of the date of publication of this BAA, the Government cannot identify whether work proposed under this BAA may be considered fundamental research and may award both fundamental and non-fundamental research.  Proposers should indicate in their proposal whether they believe the scope of the research included in their proposal is fundamental or not. While proposers should clearly explain the intended results of their research, the Government shall have sole discretion to select award instrument type and to negotiate all instrument terms and conditions with selectees. Appropriate clauses will be included in resultant awards for non-fundamental research to prescribe publication requirements and other restrictions, as appropriate.\nFor certain research projects, it may be possible that although the research being performed by the awardee is restricted research, a sub-awardee may be conducting fundamental research.  In those cases, it is the awardee\u2019s responsibility to explain in their proposal why its sub-awardee\u2019s effort is fundamental research. \nCLOUD COMPUTING.  In accordance with DFARS Clause 252.239-7010, if the development proposed requires storage of Government, or Government-related data on the cloud, offerors need to ensure that the cloud service provider proposed has been granted Provisional Authorization by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) at the level appropriate to the requirement.\nII.

Offerors are responsible for ensuring that all employees and/or subcontractors who will work on a resulting contract are eligible to do so.  Any employee who is not a U.S. citizen or a permanent resident will be restricted from working on any resultant contract unless prior approval of the Department of State or the Department of Commerce is obtained via a technical assistance agreement or an export license. Violations of these regulations can result in criminal or civil penalties. \nInformation Regarding Non-US Citizens Assigned to this Project \nContractor employees requiring access to USAF bases, AFRL facilities, and/or access to U.S. Government Information Technology (IT) networks in connection with the work on contracts, assistance instruments or other transactions awarded under this BAA must be U.S. citizens.  For the purpose of base and network access, possession of a permanent resident card (\"Green Card\") does not equate to U.S. citizenship.  This requirement does not apply to foreign nationals approved by the U.S. Department of Defense or U.S. State Department under international personnel exchange agreements with foreign governments.  It also does not apply to dual citizens who possess US citizenship, to include Naturalized citizens.  Any waivers to this requirement must be granted in writing by the Contracting Officer prior to providing access.  Specific format for waiver request will be provided upon request to the Contracting Officer.  The above requirements are in addition to any other contract requirements related to obtaining a Common Access Card (CAC). \nFor the purposes of Paragraph 1, if an IT network/system does not require AFRL to endorse a contractor's application to said network/system in order to gain access, the organization operating the IT network/system is responsible for controlling access to its system.  If an IT network/system requires a U.S. Government sponsor to endorse the application in order for access to the IT network/system, AFRL will only endorse the following types of applications, consistent with the requirements above:\nContractor employees who are U.S. citizens performing work under contracts, assistance instruments or other transactions awarded under this BAA.\nContractor employees who are non-U.S. citizens and who have been granted a waiver.\nAny additional access restrictions established by the IT network/system owner apply.\n3.  FEDERALLY FUNDED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTERS AND GOVERNMENT ENTITIES:  Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) and Government entities (e.g., Government/National laboratories, military educational institutions, etc.) are subject to applicable direct competition limitations and cannot propose to this BAA in any capacity unless they meet the following conditions: \nFFRDCs:  FFRDCs must clearly demonstrate that the proposed work is not otherwise available from the private sector; and FFRDCs must provide a letter on official letterhead from their sponsoring organization citing the specific authority establishing their eligibility to propose to Government solicitations and compete with industry, and their compliance with the associated FFRDC sponsor agreement\u2019s terms and conditions.  This information is required for FFRDCs proposing to be prime contractors or sub-awardees. \nGovernment Entities:  Government entities must clearly demonstrate that the work is not otherwise available from the private sector and provide written documentation citing the specific statutory authority and contractual authority, if relevant, establishing their ability to propose to Government solicitations.  While 10 U.S.C.\u00a7 2539b may be the appropriate statutory starting point for some entities, specific supporting regulatory guidance, together with evidence of agency approval, will still be required to fully establish eligibility. \nFFRDC and Government entity eligibility will be determined on a case-by-case basis; however, the burden to prove eligibility for all team members rests solely with the proposer.\nGovernment agencies interested in performing work related to this announcement should contact the Technical Point of Contact (TPOC).  If resulting discussions reveal a mutual interest, cooperation may be pursued via other vehicles.\n4.  ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST:  In accordance with FAR 9.5, offerors are required to identify and disclose all facts relevant to potential OCIs involving the offerors organization and any proposed team member (subawardee, consultant). Under this Section, the offeror is responsible for providing this disclosure with each proposal submitted to the solicitation. The disclosure must include the offerors, and as applicable, proposed team member\u2019s OCI mitigation plan. The OCI mitigation plan must include a description of the actions the offeror has taken, or intends to take, to prevent the existence of conflicting roles that might bias the offerors judgment and to prevent the offeror from having unfair competitive advantage. The OCI mitigation plan will specifically discuss the disclosed OCI in the context of each of the OCI limitations outlined in FAR 9.505-1 through FAR 9.505-4.\na. Agency Supplemental OCI Policy: In addition, AFRL has a supplemental OCI policy that prohibits contractors/performers from concurrently providing Scientific Engineering Technical Assistance (SETA), Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS) or similar support services and being a technical performer. Therefore, as part of the FAR 9.5 disclosure requirement above, an offeror must affirm whether the offeror or any proposed team member (subawardee, consultant) is providing SETA, A&AS, or similar support to any AFRL office(s) under: (a) a current award or subaward; or (b) a past award or subaward that ended within one calendar year prior to the proposal\u2019s submission date. If SETA, A&AS, or similar support is being or was provided to any AFRL office(s), the proposal must include:\n\n. The name of the AFRL office receiving the support;\n. The prime contract number;\n. Identification of proposed team member (subawardee, consultant) providing the support; and\n. An OCI mitigation plan in accordance with FAR 9.5.\n\nb. Government Procedures: In accordance with FAR 9.503, 9.504 and 9.506, the Government will evaluate OCI mitigation plans to avoid, neutralize or mitigate potential OCI issues before award and to determine whether it is in the Government\u2019s interest to grant a waiver. The Government will only evaluate OCI mitigation plans for proposals that are determined selectable under the solicitation evaluation criteria and funding availability. The Government may require proposers to provide additional information to assist the Government in evaluating the offerors OCI mitigation plan. If the Government determines that an offeror failed to fully disclose an OCI; or failed to provide the affirmation of AFRL support as described above; or failed to reasonably provide additional information requested by the Government to assist in evaluating the proposer\u2019s OCI mitigation plan, the Government may reject the proposal and withdraw it from consideration for award.\nIV. APPLICATION AND SUBMISSION INFORMATION:  \nAll responses to this announcement must be addressed to the Technical Point of Contact (TPOC) listed in SECTION VII.  DO NOT send white papers to the Contracting Officer.  \n1.  SUBMISSION DATES AND TIMES: \nIt is recommended that white papers be received by 4 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: \nTechnical Area 1 (TA1) and Technical Area 2 (TA2) are structured as a Closed-Staggered, 2 Step BAA. Therefore, for TA1 andTA2 ONLY:\nThe Government anticipates awarding two awards for Technical Area 1 and two awards for Technical Area 2. Therefore, white papers for TA1 and TA2 are due on 10 JAN 2022 and if requested, proposals are due on 25 FEB 2022. Please note that white papers will still be accepted for TA1 and TA2 after the 10 JAN 2022 date, however, the likelihood of funding being available is substantially reduced. \nFor all other Technical Areas:\nThe Government anticipates adding technical areas via BAA amendment in the future. All potential Offerors are requested to wait to submit white papers until the BAA announcement is updated with specific technology requirements and dates. \nWhite papers will be accepted until 4 PM EST on 30 Nov 2026, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  This BAA will close on 30 Nov 2026.\nAll offerors submitting white papers will receive notification of their evaluation results within 45 days of submission.  Offerors should email the TPOC and the Contracting Officer listed in Section VII, for status of their white paper(s) after 45 days, if no such correspondence has been received. \n2.  CONTENT AND FORMAT:   Offerors are required to submit a 3 to 5 page white paper, in the form of a PDF file, summarizing their proposed approach/solution.

ALLOWABLE CHARGES:  The cost of preparing white papers/proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.   Incurring pre-award costs for ASSISTANCE INSTRUMENTS ONLY are regulated by 2 CFR part 200.458, Pre-Award Costs.\n\te. GOVERNMENT APPROVED ACCOUNTING SYSTEM:  An offeror must have a Government approved accounting system prior to award of a cost-reimbursement contract per limitations set forth in FAR 16.301-3(a) to ensure the system is adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract.  The acceptability of an accounting system is determined based upon an audit performed by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA).   IMPORTANT:  If you do not have a DCAA approved accounting system access the following link for instructions:  https://sam.gov/opp/e628c811fafe041accdddf55fb8539bf/view?keywords=AFRL-BAA-Guide&sort=-relevance&index=&is_active=true&page=1 \nf. HUMAN USE: All research involving human subjects, to include the use of human biological specimens and human data, selected for funding must comply with Federal regulations for human subject protection.  Further, research involving human subjects that is conducted or supported by the DoD must comply with 32 CFR 219, \u201cProtection of Human Subjects\u201d found at:  http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_07/32cfr219_07.html,  and DoD Instruction 3216.02, \u201cProtection of Human Subjects and Adherence to Ethical Standards in DoD-Supported Research\u201d found at:  http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/321602p.pdf.\nInstitutions awarded funding for research involving human subjects must provide documentation of a current Assurance of Compliance with Federal regulations for human subject protection, for example a Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Human Research Protection Federal Wide Assurance found at: http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp.\nAll institutions engaged in human subject research, to include subcontractors, must have a valid assurance. In addition, personnel involved in human subject research must document the completion of appropriate training for the protection of human subjects.\nFor all research that will involve human subjects in the first year or phase of the project, the institution must submit evidence of a plan for review by an institutional review board (IRB) as part of the proposal. The IRB conducting the review must be the IRB identified on the institution\u2019s Assurance of Compliance. The protocol, separate from the proposal, must include a detailed description of the research plan, study population, risks and benefits of study participation, recruitment and consent process, data collection, and data analysis. The designated IRB should be consulted for guidance on writing the protocol. The informed consent document must comply with 32 CFR 219.116. A valid Assurance of Compliance and evidence of appropriate training by all investigators should accompany the protocol for review by the IRB. \nIn addition to a local IRB approval, an AFRL-level human subject regulatory review and approval is required for all research conducted or supported by the DoD. The Air Force office responsible for managing the award can provide guidance and information about the AFRL-level review process.  Confirmation of a current Assurance of Compliance and appropriate human subjects protection training is required before AFRL-level approval can be issued.\nThe time required to complete the IRB review/approval process will vary depending on the complexity of the research and/or the level of risk to study participants; ample time should be allotted to complete the approval process. The IRB approval process can last between 1 to 3 months, followed by a DoD review that could last 3 to 6 months. No funding may be used toward human subject research until all approvals are granted.  Therefore, in their cost proposals offerors should separate human use into a separate option.\ng. SUPPLIER PERFORMANCE RISK SYSTEM (SPRS). Offerors should have a BASIC NIST SP 800 171 DoD Assessment in the SPRS (https://www.sprs.csd.disa.mil/). Basic assessment is to be conducted by the offeror. \nV. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:\n1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:\nOverall Scientific and Technical Merit -- The soundness of approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology, \nRelated Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, \nOpenness, Maturity and Assurance of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology, and \nReasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).  \nNo further evaluation criteria will be used to select white papers for proposal invitation.  Proposals will be evaluated IAW this evaluation criteria only and categorized/selected for award as detailed in Section V.2.b.2.  White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  \n2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  \nOnly Government employees on the BAA team will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as \"handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks.\"  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by Government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.  \nWHITE PAPER/PROPOSAL REVIEW PROCESS:\nFIRST STEP \u2013 White Paper Reviews: The Government will review White Papers to identify those with the greatest potential to meet the Air Force\u2019s needs based on the criteria above. If funding is available for an identified white paper, AFRL/RI will request a formal technical and cost proposal from the Offeror. For white papers not of interest to the Government, or for which funding is not available, those Offerors will receive letters from the Government indicating the basis for non-selection. \nSECOND STEP \u2013 Proposal Review and Selection Process\na) Categories: Based on the evaluation, proposals will be categorized as Selectable or Not Selectable (see definitions below). The selection of one or more offerors for award will be based on the evaluation, as well as importance to agency programs and funding availability.\n1. Selectable: Proposals are recommended for acceptance, if sufficient funding* is available.  \n2. Not Selectable: Even if sufficient funding existed, the proposal should not be funded.\n* Selectable proposals will be designated as funded or unfunded.  Letters will be sent to the unfunded offerors. These proposals may be funded at a later date without reevaluation, if funding becomes available.\nb) The Government reserves the right to award some, all, or none of the proposals. When the Government elects to award only a part of a proposal, the selected part may be categorized as Selectable, though the proposal as a whole may not merit such a categorization.\nc) Proposal Risk Assessment: Proposals\u2019 technical, cost, and schedule risk will be assessed as part of the above evaluation criteria\u2019s application. Proposal risk relates to the identification and assessment of the risks associated with an offeror's proposed approach as it relates to accomplishing the proposed effort. Tradeoffs of the assessed risk will be weighed against the potential scientific benefit. Proposal risk for schedule relates to an assessment of the risks associated with the offeror's proposed number of hours, labor categories, materials, or other cost elements as it relates to meeting the proposed period of performance.\nd) Prior to award of a potentially successful offer, the Contracting Officer will make a determination regarding price reasonableness and realism.\n3.  FEDERAL AWARDEE PERFORMANCE AND INTEGRITY INFORMATION SYSTEM (FAPIIS) PUBLIC ACCESS:  The Government is required to review and consider any information about the applicant that is in the FAPIIS before making any award in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $250,000) over the period of performance.  An applicant may review and comment on any information about itself that a federal awarding agency previously entered.  The Government will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS in making a judgment about the applicant's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 2 CFR \u00a7 200.205 Federal Awarding Agency Review of Risk Posed by Applicants and per FAR 9.104-6.\n4. ADEQUATE PRICE COMPETITION: As this BAA is an Open BAA, adequate price competition is not anticipated since there is no set response time, and proposals are evaluated at the time of receipt. Offerors whose proposals are selected for award will be expected to submit certified cost and pricing data on contracts exceeding $2M. Adequate price competition is anticipated for TA1 and TA2 as those portions of the BAA are closed. \nVI. STEP TWO INFORMATION \u2013 REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL & AWARD:\n1.  PROPOSAL FORMATING: When developing proposals, reference the AFRL \"Broad Agency Announcement (BAA): Guide for Industry,\" Mar 2015, and RI-Specific Proposal Preparation Instructions, Aug 2021, which may be accessed at: https://sam.gov/opp/e628c811fafe041accdddf55fb8539bf/view?keywords=AFRL-BAA-GUIDE&sort=-relevance&index=&is_active=true&page=1 . Always reference the newest versions of these documents.\nPlease note that less than 12 point font is acceptable for graphics and illustrations (as in labels and short descriptions) as long as it is readable when printed out on standard 8x11 paper. \n2.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the research areas of interest and expected results within the broad topic areas as described in the Technology Requirements section of this BAA and of interest to the Government may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the TPOC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.  All offerors submitting proposals will receive notification of their evaluation results within 45 days of submission.  Offerors should email the TPOC and the Contracting Officer listed in Section VII, for status of their proposal after 45 days, if no such correspondence has been received. \n3.  DEBRIEFINGS: If a debriefing is requested in accordance with the time guidelines set out in FAR 15.505 and 15.506, a debriefing will be provided, but the debriefing content may vary to be consistent with the procedures that govern BAAs (FAR 35.016). Debriefings will not be provided for white papers. \n4.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  \nFACILITY CLEARANCE. Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a TOP SECRET/SCI facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to TOP SECRET/SCI information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Proposers to TA2 must demonstrate the ability to access and store data at the TOP SECRET/SCI level.\nEXPORT CONTROL LAWS. Awards under this solicitation may require access to, or generation of, data subject to export control laws and regulations. Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) and have a legitimate business purpose may participate in this solicitation.  For questions, contact DLIS on-line at http://www.dla.mil/HQ/InformationOperations/LogisticsInformationServices.aspx or at the DLA Logistics Information Service, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49037-3084, and telephone number 1-800-352-2255 (24/7).\u00a0 You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your white paper/proposal.\nSMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION. The Government encourages the best sources from the scientific and industrial communities to propose, including small business concerns, large businesses, academia and non-profit entities. Non-small businesses are encouraged to team with small business concerns to come up with the best technical solutions and obtain the best mix of cost, performance and schedule. \nACTIONS FOR THE PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, CONTROLLED INFORMATION, KEY PERSONNEL AND CRITICAL TECHNOLOGIES. Offerors who are requested to submit a proposal under this solicitation of grants, cooperative agreements, Technology Investment Agreements, and other non-procurement transactions only shall submit specific information for all key personnel, whether or not the individuals\u2019 efforts under the project are to be funded by the DoD. Specific requirements will be detailed in the Request for Proposal (RFP) letter. The information shall be included in the Research and Related/Key Person Profile (Expanded) form (https://www.grants.gov/forms/r-r-family.html). This collection only applies to persons identified as key personnel. This information shall not be included in the overall proposal page limits. Failure to submit this information may cause the proposal to be returned without further review, and the DoD reserves the right to request further details before making a final determination on funding an effort. This information will be used to support protection of intellectual property, controlled information, key personnel, and information about critical technologies relevant to national security. Additionally, this information will be used to limit undue influence, including foreign talent programs, by countries that desire to exploit United States\u2019 technology within the DoD research, science and technology, and innovation enterprise. \nBURDEN REDUCTION. With the exception of paragraph d. above, in order to reduce grant recipient reporting burden, effective 1 JAN 2019, use of the SF-424B is optional. Also, effective 1 JAN 2020, the SAM will become the central repository for common government-wide certifications and representations required of Federal grants recipients. As registration in SAM is required for eligibility for a Federal award and registration must be updated annually, Federal agencies will use SAM information to comply with award requirements and avoid increased burden and costs of separate requests for such information, unless the recipient fails to meet a Federal award requirement, or there is a need to make updates to their SAM registration for other purposes. (OMB Memorandum M 18-24).  \n5.  DATA RIGHTS: \nSBIR RIGHTS.  The potential for inclusion of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or data rights other than unlimited on awards is recognized.  In accordance with (IAW) the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR Policy Directive, Section 8(b), SBIR data rights clauses are non-negotiable and must not be the subject of negotiations pertaining to an award, or diminished or removed during award administration.  Issuance of an award will not be made conditional based on forfeit of data rights. If the SBIR awardee wishes to transfer its SBIR data rights to the Air Force or to a third party, it must do so in writing under a separate agreement. A decision by the awardee to relinquish, transfer, or modify in any way its SBIR data rights must be made without pressure or coercion by the agency or any other party.  \nNON-SBIR RIGHTS. \nNon-SBIR data rights less than unlimited will be evaluated and negotiated on a case-by-case basis.  Government Purpose Rights are anticipated for data developed with DoD\u2013reimbursed Independent Research and Development (IR&D) funding.\nThe Air Force Research Laboratory is engaged in the discovery, development, and integration of warfighting technologies for our air, space, and cyberspace forces. As such, rights in technical data and noncommercial computer software (NCS) developed or delivered under this contract are of significant concern to the Government. The Government will therefore carefully consider any restrictions on the use of technical data, NCS, and NCS documentation which could result in transition difficulty or less-than full and open competition for subsequent development of this technology.\nThird Party Software.  DFARS 252.227-7014(d) describes requirements for incorporation of third party computer software. Any third party software (commercial and noncommercial) to be incorporated into a deliverable must be clearly identified in the proposal. Prior to delivery of any third party software, the contractor will obtain an appropriate license for the Government, and the written approval of the contracting officer.\n IDENTIFICATION & ASSERTION.  IAW DFARS 252.227-7017, the Identification and Assertion of Use, Release, or Disclosure Restriction provision applies.  See AFRL/RI Specific Proposal Preparation Instructions for further guidance and samples.\n6.  REPORTING:   \n     a. Contract Applicable:  Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be given complete instructions on the submission process for the reports.  \n     b. FAPIIS Applicable:  As required by 2 CFR 200 Appendix XII of the Uniform Guidance and FAR 9.104-6, non-federal entities (NFEs) are required to disclose in FAPIIS any information about criminal, civil, and administrative proceedings, and/or affirm that there is no new information to provide.  This applies to NFEs that receive federal awards (currently active grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts) greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of an award/project.\n7.
