================================================================================
SECTION B: TASK OBJECTIVE
================================================================================

General Admiral proposes to develop an integrated AI-driven planning and gaming system that revolutionizes Air Operations Center (AOC) planning by reducing Master Air Attack Plan (MAAP) development time from 36 hours to under 4 hours. Our solution combines cutting-edge automated planning algorithms with a commercial game engine architecture to enable human planners to rapidly build, rehearse, and assess combat plans against peer adversaries.

Our approach leverages General Admiral's existing PlannerAI platform (currently deployed in logistics optimization across 14 Fortune 500 companies) and integrates it with a modified version of the Unity game engine to create an intuitive, responsive planning environment. This integrated solution addresses both Technical Area 1 (Interactive Plan Refinement) and Technical Area 2 (Plan Gaming and Outcome Analysis) as a unified system, ensuring seamless data flow and optimal human-machine collaboration.

Key Objectives:
1. Deliver rapid plan synthesis generating plausible attack plans in under 60 seconds
2. Provide interactive force allocation interface with real-time feasibility feedback
3. Enable gaming-based plan execution and outcome analysis across thousands of scenarios
4. Support continuous plan refinement with AI-guided optimization
5. Integrate with existing Air Force data formats and classification requirements

SECTION C: TECHNICAL SUMMARY AND PROPOSED DELIVERABLES
================================================================================

TECHNICAL APPROACH

General Admiral's Fight Tonight solution architecture consists of four integrated components:

1. RAPIDPLAN AI ENGINE (TA1 Capability)
Our RapidPlan AI engine employs hierarchical task network (HTN) planning combined with genetic algorithms to generate course-grained attack plans within seconds. The system operates in three iterative modes:

   - Instant Feasibility Mode: Returns yes/no feasibility assessment within 5 seconds based on
     high-level resource constraints and target priorities
   - Coarse Planning Mode: Generates 8-12 plausible plan options within 60 seconds using
     approximation techniques for fuel, timing, and weapon-target pairings
   - Refinement Mode: Continuously improves plan fidelity in background, adding detail on
     routing, deconfliction, and mission timing

The engine uses Monte Carlo tree search to explore the space of task prioritizations and resource allocations, providing diversity analysis that highlights meaningful differences between plan options. Our innovation is the use of "planning surrogates" - lightweight models that approximate complex constraints during initial planning, then swap in high-fidelity models during refinement.

2. GAMEFORGE PLANNING INTERFACE (TA2 Capability)
Built on Unity 2021 LTS, GameForge provides three integrated visual interfaces:

   a) Drag-and-Drop Force Allocation: Planners allocate aircraft to target sets using an
      interactive map interface. Real-time API calls to RapidPlan provide instant feedback on
      plan feasibility, resource conflicts, and estimated effects.

   b) 4D Mission Timeline: A unique temporal visualization showing mission timing, aircraft
      movements, and target effects across time. Planners can scrub through the mission timeline,
      identify conflicts, and adjust timing interactively.

   c) Gaming Execution Environment: Full 3D battlespace visualization for playing plans against
      AI opponents. Supports faster-than-realtime execution (up to 100x speed) and branching
      scenario exploration.

3. ADVERSARY AI MODELS
We will develop three tiers of adversary AI:

   - Reactive AI: Rule-based responses to friendly actions (appropriate for quick analysis)
   - Strategic AI: Machine learning models trained on historical conflict data and wargames
   - Expert AI: Integration with subject matter expert decision trees for high-fidelity simulation

All AI models will be tunable for difficulty/competence level, enabling planners to test against varying adversary capabilities.

4. ANALYTICS & DATA ARCHITECTURE
Our cloud-native data architecture uses PostgreSQL for plan storage with custom indexing for rapid retrieval of plan variants. Analytics engine provides:

   - Plan comparison metrics (effectiveness, risk, resource utilization)
   - Outcome distribution visualization across hundreds of simulated executions
   - Automated variant exploration identifying plan sensitivities
   - Export capabilities for integration with Air Force systems


RISK MITIGATION

General Admiral recognizes several key risks and our mitigation strategies:

Risk: Plan conditioning may require more detail than RapidPlan can efficiently generate
Mitigation: We will work closely with TA2 teams via Planning Interface Working Group to define minimum viable plan fidelity. Our hierarchical planning approach allows graceful degradation if full detail cannot be achieved within time constraints.

Risk: Unity game engine may not meet classification requirements for TOP SECRET/SCI
Mitigation: General Admiral maintains a SCIF facility in Alexandria, VA with TOP SECRET/SCI accreditation. We will deploy air-gapped development environments and implement all NISPOM requirements for handling classified information.

Risk: Integration between independently developed TA1 and TA2 components may prove difficult
Mitigation: By proposing an integrated solution, we eliminate integration risk. However, we commit to clean API boundaries and will participate actively in the Planning Interface Working Group to ensure our interfaces can support other performers' components if needed.


TEAM QUALIFICATIONS

General Admiral brings extensive experience in AI planning and defense simulation:

- 8 years developing autonomous planning systems for commercial applications
- Current Secret-level facility clearance (TOP SECRET/SCI upgrade in progress)
- Partnership with SimuTech Defense (small business) for adversary AI development
- Dr. Marcus Wellington (PI) - 15 years experience in automated planning, former DARPA performer
- Team of 12 engineers with Unity/Unreal engine experience averaging 6 years each
- Existing relationship with AFRL for Phase 2 transition support

- Interface responsiveness: <200ms lag for all user interactions
- Plan quality: Successfully schedule 95%+ of requested missions given adequate resources
- Workload reduction: Enable 2-person team to generate and assess plans vs. current 20+ person staff
- User acceptance: >80% positive feedback from operational planners in evaluation events
- Scenario scale: Support planning for 1000+ targets, 500+ aircraft, 50+ bases

We will conduct internal user testing with retired Air Force planners monthly starting Month 6 to continuously refine usability.


PARTNERSHIP AND TRANSITION

General Admiral recognizes that operational adoption is critical to program success. We commit to:

- Quarterly engagement with Strategic Planning User Group
- Active participation in Planning Interface Working Group
- Demonstration of Phase 1 prototype at AOC Nellis AFB (if access granted)
- Development of transition plan for Phase 2 integration with Kessel Run architecture
- Documentation suitable for handoff to operational units

Our small business partner SimuTech Defense will provide 15% of the effort, ensuring small business participation and bringing specialized wargaming expertise.


INNOVATION HIGHLIGHTS

General Admiral's proposal offers several innovative features beyond baseline requirements:

1. "Rewind and Branch" capability - planners can return to any point in plan development,
   create alternative branches, and compare outcomes side-by-side

2. Collaborative planning mode - multiple planners can work on the same plan simultaneously
   with real-time synchronization

3. AI "Planning Assistant" - natural language interface allowing planners to request changes
   ("add more tanker support in the northern sector") without manual manipulation

4. Automated "Red Team" - AI that actively looks for plan vulnerabilities and suggests
   adversary strategies that could defeat the plan


SUMMARY

General Admiral's integrated TA1/TA2 solution leverages proven commercial AI planning technology and game engine architecture to deliver a revolutionary air operations planning capability. Our team's expertise in autonomous planning, defense applications, and human-centered design positions us to successfully execute this critical program. We are committed to working collaboratively with the Government evaluation team, other performers, and operational users to ensure Fight Tonight delivers transformational capability to the Air Force.

We respectfully request the opportunity to submit a full technical and cost proposal for the Fight Tonight program.
